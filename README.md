# 🐶 Pet Management System (OOP Example in Python)

This project demonstrates the basic concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python:
- **Class and Objects**
- **Inheritance**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Polymorphism**

---

## 📘 Description
The project defines a base class `Pet` and three subclasses: `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Fish`.  
Each subclass overrides the `speak()` method to represent unique behaviors.

Encapsulation is demonstrated through private and protected attributes, and polymorphism is shown when iterating through different pet objects in a single function.
